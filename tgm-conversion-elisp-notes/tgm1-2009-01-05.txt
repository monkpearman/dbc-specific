Dry collodion negatives
  SN:       Negatives coated with a dry collodion solution were 
            introduced in the 1850s. Although convenient because they 
            could be stored until ready to be exposed, they were little 
            used because they required long exposure times. Hand-coated 
            emulsions made these negatives look like wet plates.
