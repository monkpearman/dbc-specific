;;; ==============================

Given enough indirections a UUID can resolve _any_ ojbect (and the values contained therein).

This being the case, we can store all UUID/object key/value pairs in a _single_ global hash-table. 

It doesn't matter what class or type the UUID dereferences, so long as the
dereferenced object (the value) is itself identified by a UUID we can simply
chase pointers until we find the thing we are looking for.

If we store all objects in the DBC sytem in a single global hash-table and
provide a set of interface methods for accessing, setting, and updating these
objects allows us the following benfits:

 - We can limit the number of locks we must acquire and hold when mutating the system

 - We may be able to find a way to keep track of expired objects by specifing
   weakness rules for the hash-table.
   e.g. If both the UUID key and Object it dereferences are expired then the
   pair will not remain accessible in the global hash-table and therefor we will
   pre-empt chasing of pointers for non-existing objects.

In order for the approach outlined above to work we need to require and maintain
consistency w/r/t the following:

 - all objects in the dbc-system must have a UUID

 - The UUID -> object mapping for persistent objects can not change!

 - all active objects in the dbc-system must have a UUID present as a key in the global hash-table

 - all active objects must be reachable by a look-up on their UUID in the global hash-table

 - the primary means of referencing an object in the dbc-system is through the object's UUID

The last requirement; that our primary means of referencing an object vias it's
UUID is prone to creation of tedious code.

Our main obstacle will be to provide a clean interface of specializing methods
which paper over this tedium while ensuring that the system doesn't become
corrupted or inconsistent. This obstacle is likeley to be further complicated by
the interaction with whatever persistence backend we choose esp. if that backend
is implemented with MOP magic.

In order for this to work we need to maintain very tight control on the core set
of objects that we persist and define the necessary auxiliary methods to ensure
that the slot-values of our persistent classes don't change out from under
us... This is ___especially__ important when a slot-value is an instance of a
class!!!

Following provides an example of the basic idioms we imagine.

 *dbc-global-hash-table*
   key        value
  --------------------
  UUID-J ---> OBJECT-L   
  UUID-K ---> OBJECT-M
  UUUD-Q ---> OBJECT-N
  UUUD-Y ---> OBJECT-O
  UUUD-Z ---> OBJECT-P

UUID-J dereferences OBJECT-L
 OBJECT-L is an instance of an entity class
 OBJECT-L contains slot hash-for-entity-foo. 
 It's slot-value is consed pair:
 ( UUID-K . UUID-Y )

UUID-K dereferences OBJECT-M 
OBJECT-M contains a slot psuedonym-hash with slot-value #<HASH-TABLE ... >

UUID-Y dereferences OBJECT-O
OBJECT-O contains a slot pseudonym-list which lists the known pseudonyms of OBJECT-L

OBJECT-O exists as a hash-table value as UUID-Y in the table contained of OBJECT-M pseudonym-hash slot

So, imagine we want to find the pseudonyms for the entity OBJECT-L

To do this we need to get from OBJECT-L to OBJECT-O.
Because we don't refer to instances directly we refer OBJECT-L to it through UUID-J:

 (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*)
 => OBJECT-L

Get the key/value pair of UUIDs which dereferece OBJECT-M and OBJECT-O e.g. a
hash-table and a key into the table:

 (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)
 => (UUID-K . UUID-Y)

 (gethash (car (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) ; UUID-K
          *dbc-global-hash-table*)
 => OBJECT-M 

 (slot-value (gethash (car (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) ; UUID-K
                       *dbc-global-hash-table*) ; OBJECT-M
              'pseudonym-hash)
  ;=> #<HASH-TABLE ... >


 (gethash (gethash (cdr (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) *dbc-global-hash-table*) ; UUID-Y
          (slot-value (gethash (car (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) ; UUID-K
                               *dbc-global-hash-table*) ; OBJECT-M
                      'pseudonym-hash)                  ;#<HASH-TABLE ... >
          *dbc-global-hash-table*)
 ;=> OBJECT-O

 (slot-value (gethash (gethash (cdr (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) *dbc-global-hash-table*) ; UUID-Y
                      (slot-value (gethash (car (slot-value (gethash UUID-J *dbc-global-hash-table*) 'hash-for-entity-foo)) ; UUID-K
                                           *dbc-global-hash-table*) ; OBJECT-M
                                  'pseudonym-hash) ;#<HASH-TABLE ... >
                      *dbc-global-hash-table*)     ; OBJECT-O
             'pseudonym-list)
 => ( ... list of pseudonyms for OBJECT-M ... )
