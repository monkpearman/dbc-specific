;;; ==============================

* We have classes with slots named:
  `naf-entity-role-appearance-coref'
  We need to model this as a class b/c
  - roles can coref across naf-entities
  - roles can coref with themes (and possibley categories)
  - roles can potentially embody their own namespace
